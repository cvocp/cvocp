This directory contains data associated with the paper:

Young-Bum Kim and Benjamin Snyder. Unsupervised Consonant-Vowel Prediction over
Hundreds of Languages. ACL 2013.

We provide one dictionary file for each target language under the ./data/ folder.
Names of these files correspond to language code ISO 639-3.
Within each file, each line corresponds to a word and its term frequency.

The lines are formatted as follows:

WORD@TERM_FREQUENCY

The at sign (@) is used as a delimiter


We also provide the list file of nasals, non-nasal consonants, and vowels.
Within each file, each line corresponds to a single letter.
